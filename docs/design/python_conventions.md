# Python Conventions

This document captures Python-specific conventions for this project. It exists to record
rules that apply only to Python code and that were intentionally removed from the
language-agnostic `coding_conventions.md` during a refactor.

Treat this file as the authoritative reference for Python idioms and practices in the
repository. If the project uses a language other than Python in a module, map these
rules to the language-specific equivalents or ignore them for that module.

## Python Version

- Supported Python minor versions and the project's chosen interpreter must be
  documented in the project `README` or dependency manifests (for example,
  `pyproject.toml`). Use the project's documented Python version when writing or
  updating Python code.

## Typing & Structures

- Prefer explicit typing for public APIs and module boundaries (use typing, Protocols,
  or ABCs where appropriate).
- Use dataclasses or language-appropriate value-object patterns for simple immutable
  data carriers when they improve clarity.

## Dependency Rule (migrated from coding conventions)

- Minimise direct third-party dependencies in `domain/` (core) modules. Domain modules
  should depend only on the standard library and small, stable, purpose-specific
  utilities where strictly necessary.
- When a domain module needs functionality provided by an external library (I/O,
  persistence, external APIs), define an explicit interface (for example an abstract
  base class or Protocol) in the domain or application layer and provide the concrete
  implementation in an `infrastructure/` or `adapters/` module.
- Inject concrete implementations from infrastructure/adapters into the
  domain/application at runtime (dependency injection or explicit factory wiring). Do
  not import infrastructure implementations directly from domain modules.
- Document any exception to this rule in the PR and explain why the dependency is
  necessary in the domain layer.

## Linting & Formatting

- Use the project's configured formatter and linter toolchain for Python (for example,
  Black, Ruff, isort). Configure them consistently and run them as part of the developer
  workflow and CI.
- Follow the project's agreed maximum line length; default recommendation: 88 characters
  for Python code.

## Docstrings & Comments

- Document public modules, classes, and functions with clear docstrings. Adopt a
  consistent docstring style (the project may prefer Google-style, NumPy-style, or
  reStructuredText) and document the chosen style in the project's contributor guide.

## Encoding & I/O

- Explicitly specify `encoding="utf-8"` when opening files. When invoking subprocesses
  with text output, ensure encoding is handled explicitly by the chosen API.

## Testing

- Follow the project's testing conventions for Python. Prefer unit tests that exercise
  behaviour via public interfaces.
- Test files should live under the top-level `tests/` directory and mirror the module
  layout where practical.

## Exceptions

- Any exception to these conventions must be documented in the PR and approved by
  reviewers.

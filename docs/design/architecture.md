# Architecture Reference

This document centralises the architectural design of this project. It explains the
"why" behind structural decisions and provides a reference for implementing features
consistently.

______________________________________________________________________

## Overview

The project is built using *Domain-Driven Design (DDD)*, *Command Query Responsibility
Segregation (CQRS)*, and *Event Sourcing*, organised by modules.

**Core philosophy:** Architecture is a constraint that keeps the codebase coherent as it
grows. Every decision is enforced at the module level and validated at build time.

## Modular Philosophy

This project adopts a modular philosophy: modules are first-class design units with
enforced boundaries, explicit public APIs, and automated verification where practical.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Modules as Design Boundaries

- Each module has strict rules about what can be imported from outside.
- Accidental violations are caught at build time, not discovered during maintenance.

#### 2. Explicit Public API Contracts

- **Module-to-module boundaries:** Modules communicate through events
  (publish/subscribe) or SPIs (Service Provider Interfaces—public ABCs with internal
  implementations). Cross-module imports use root exports only.
- **Infrastructure exemption:** Infrastructure packages (`shared/`, composition root)
  are not subject to public API rules. They can import from any layer as needed for
  dependency injection and framework concerns.
- **Domain layer:** Always internal. Domain objects (aggregates, value objects) remain
  encapsulated within their module. A module's public API must be explicitly declared in
  a clear, language-appropriate place (for example: a module export file, package
  manifest, or public API declaration). Avoid implicitly exporting internals.
- Sub-packages are allowed if structurally necessary (for example, `entrypoint/cli/` or
  `entrypoint/web/`) provided their public exports are explicitly declared.
- Package facades should only re-export symbols from their own module boundary. Do not
  re-export symbols from sibling modules without explicit intent.

#### 3. Event-Driven Communication

- Modules primarily communicate through domain events on a message bus.
- Alternatively, modules may expose Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs)—public ABCs that
  other modules can depend on, with implementations remaining internal.
- No direct imports between module internals; no shared mutable state.
- Event subscriptions and SPI contracts decouple modules from each other.

#### 4. Automated Verification and Documentation

TODO: Define the automated verification and documentation process.

This section is intentionally left as a placeholder. Suggested next steps (to be
approved and executed by the developer):

- Define a verification tool or script that enforces module boundaries and layer
  dependency rules.
- Add documentation generation steps (optional) and a CI job that validates
  documentation links.
- Document the verification process here once implemented.

### Benefits

- **Resilience to refactoring:** Module names and responsibilities may change; the rules
  remain constant.
- **Early detection of drift:** Architects don't discover structural violations months
  later during a code review.
- **Clarity for new contributors:** The explicit public API makes it obvious what each
  module exposes.
- **Maintainability:** As the codebase grows, clear boundaries prevent it from becoming
  a tangled monolith.

## Modules (Abstract)

A module is an organisational boundary within which domain language and models are
consistent. This project uses modules to partition responsibilities and enforce strict
separation.

Modules fall into two categories:

- *Command modules* (write side) — Maintain aggregates, enforce invariants, emit events
- *Query modules* (read side) — Project events into read models, serve queries

Each follows a layered structure (details in "Command Modules vs Query Modules" section
below). All modules share common layers:

- *application* — Use case handlers (commands for write modules, queries for read
  modules)
- *infrastructure* — Concrete implementations (repositories, stores, external services)
- *entrypoint* — User-facing entry points (CLI, web routes, event listeners, schedulers)

**Module independence:** Module names and responsibilities may change over time. The
rules below apply to every module regardless of its concrete domain.

## Shared Package (Non-Module)

`shared/` is *not* a module. It is a place to keep abstract classes and common services
that other modules may extend or consume.

**Rules for shared/:**

- Still follows the same layer separation: `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`,
  `entrypoint`.
- Still obeys the dependency rules below.
- May be imported by any module.
- Contains no domain-specific models or logic.

## Module Structure (Abstract)

```
project_root/
├── <module_command>/                 # Command Module (write side)
│   ├── domain
│   ├── application
│   ├── infrastructure
│   └── entrypoint
├── <module_query>/                   # Query Module (read side)
│   ├── projection
│   ├── application
│   ├── infrastructure
│   └── entrypoint
└── shared/                           # Shared abstractions and services (non-module)
    ├── domain
    ├── application
    ├── infrastructure
    └── entrypoint
```

**Key insight:** Modules follow a layered structure. Command modules use domain for
write-side aggregates; query modules use projection for read-side materialisation.
Layers communicate downward (interface → application → domain/projection).
Infrastructure can call any layer but is never called directly (always injected).

## Command Modules vs Query Modules

This project enforces strict separation between write-side (command) and read-side
(query) modules.

### Command Modules

**Purpose:** Maintain aggregates, enforce invariants, emit events.

**Structure:**

```
<command_module>/
├── domain               # Aggregate, Repository ABC, value objects, invariants
├── application          # Command handlers (use cases)
├── infrastructure       # Concrete implementations (repositories, external services)
└── entrypoint           # CLI/web entry points
```

**Strict rules:**

- Domain always internal (no exports)
- Events exported at module root
- Cross-module boundaries: events or SPIs only
- No shared mutable state

### Query Modules

**Purpose:** Project events into read models, serve queries without modifying state.

**Structure:**

```
<query_module>/
├── projection           # Projection documents, read model stores
├── application          # Query handlers (read use cases)
├── infrastructure       # Concrete projection stores
└── entrypoint           # CLI/web entry points
```

**Pragmatic approach:**

- Projections are always internal (denormalised views, not aggregates)
- Query DTOs exported at root for cross-module queries
- Cross-module queries allowed for performance (read models can aggregate data from
  multiple modules)
- No modification of state; queries are side-effect-free
- Read model stores may be shared if performance or consistency requires it

**Key distinction:** Query modules prioritise *performance and usability* over strict
isolation because reads never corrupt domain invariants. Command modules maintain
*absolute rigour* to protect the write side.

## Layer Dependencies

Strict module hierarchy is an architectural constraint and should be enforced by
conventions, verification scripts, or build-time checks where possible:

```
entrypoint → application → domain
infrastructure → any layer (never the reverse)
```

### Domain Layer (`domain`)

- Minimise external dependencies. Domain code should not depend on infrastructure or
  other modules; keep the core model and invariants isolated from implementation
  concerns.
- Define aggregates, value objects, and abstract contracts appropriate to the project's
  language.
- Encapsulate business logic and invariants in the domain.

### Application Layer (`application`)

- *No infrastructure imports.* Depends only on domain ABCs.
- Defines use cases as command/query handlers.
- Orchestrates: call domain logic → call injected ABCs → return minimal result DTOs.
- No business logic here — that lives in the domain.

### Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure`)

- Concrete implementations of domain/application contracts.
- Responsible for persistence, external APIs, and platform-specific concerns.
- Provide implementations that are wired into higher layers at the composition root;
  avoid direct imports of infrastructure from domain code.

### Entrypoint Layer (`entrypoint`)

- *User-facing entry points.* CLI commands, web routes, API endpoints, event listeners,
  scheduled jobs.
- Parses user input, calls application handlers, formats output.
- Depends only on application handlers (no domain logic here).

### Dependency Placement (Guidance)

Dependency placement and module-coupling rules are an architectural concern and live
here. Language-specific implementation details (for example, how to express interfaces
or perform dependency injection in a particular language) belong in language convention
documents.

- Core/domain modules should avoid direct dependencies on infrastructure or external
  libraries whenever practical.
- Define abstract interfaces or contracts in the appropriate higher-level layer (domain
  or application) and provide concrete implementations in `infrastructure/` or adapter
  modules.
- Wire concrete implementations at the composition root; do not import infrastructure
  implementations directly from domain modules.
- Document and justify any exceptions in the architecture decision log or PR
  description.

## Data Flow (Abstract Example)

```
1. User input via CLI or web
   ↓
2. Entrypoint layer parses input and builds a command/query
   ↓
3. Application handler orchestrates domain logic
   ↓
4. Domain aggregate validates invariants and emits events
   ↓
5. Repository persists events and publishes them
   ↓
6. Subscribers project events into read models
   ↓
7. Handler returns a minimal result DTO
```

**Key points:**

- Aggregates decide what happened, not handlers.
- Repositories persist and dispatch events.
- Events are the bridge between modules.

## Data Storage (Abstract)

### Append-Only Event Store

**Properties:**

- Append-only: events are never modified or deleted.
- Immutable: event type and data are frozen at insert time.
- Registry-based deserialisation to avoid reflection magic.

### Projections

Projections are read models derived from events. They are fully rebuildable and
optimised for query patterns.

## Dependency Injection

All dependencies are injected through a single composition root. Infrastructure types
are instantiated only there and never imported directly elsewhere.

**Pattern (abstract):**

- Domain/Application depend on ABCs.
- Infrastructure provides concrete implementations.
- Composition root wires handlers with concrete instances.

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

Commands and queries are strictly separated at the module level.

- *Command handlers* orchestrate state changes; aggregates decide what happened and emit
  events.
- *Query handlers* read from projections only, never the event store.
- Handlers return minimal result DTOs, not full aggregates.

## Event Sourcing

The event store is the system of records. All state changes are captured as immutable
events.

**Event design (abstract):**

- Events are immutable data records representing facts that have occurred. Prefer
  simple, serialisable data structures with no behavioural logic.

### Event Immutability

Events must be treated as immutable once created. Enforce immutability using the
language's facilities or clear conventions (for example, read-only data types, immutable
value objects, or defensive copying). The implementation details will vary by language;
document language-specific patterns in the language convention documents.

### Abstract Event Types

Every concrete event type should declare a stable identifier (an "event type") and a
well-defined schema. Intermediate base event types may be used for grouping and should
be clearly marked as abstract in the language-appropriate way. Document the event
registry and deserialisation strategy in an implementation guide.

**Aggregate rehydration:**

- Aggregates are rebuilt by replaying event history in order.
- Consider snapshotting when replay cost becomes significant.

## Message Bus

Events are published to a message bus, allowing modules to react without direct
coupling.

- Subscribers are registered at the composition root.
- A synchronous in-memory bus is acceptable for local development.
- An async bus can replace it without changing modules.

## File Granularity

*One concept per file.* This is a hard constraint.

Physical location follows clear patterns. Aggregates and value objects live in `domain`
and are not exported as part of other modules' internals. Application handlers follow
their layer structure. Sub-packages are allowed if they reflect structural needs (for
example, `entrypoint/cli` for CLI commands, `entrypoint/web` for web routes), but public
exports must be declared explicitly in a module's public API declaration.

- **Aggregate** — `domain/<aggregate>`
- **Aggregate repository/ABC** — `domain/<aggregate>_repository`
- **Use case command + handler** — `application/<use_case>`
- **Concrete implementation** — `infrastructure/<tech>_<concept>`
- **Query handler** — `application/<query>`
- **CLI command** — `entrypoint/cli/<command>`
- **Web route** — `entrypoint/web/<route>`
- **Module public API** — module root export / public API file

## Defensive Parsing (Abstract)

When ingesting evolving external data:

- Missing keys are normal.
- Unknown fields are ignored.
- Only extract what is needed for the current feature.
- Fail fast on corrupted data (e.g., invalid JSON).

### Testing Strategy (Abstract)

### Fakes, Not Mocks

For each module interface or abstract contract, provide in-memory fakes for unit testing
where practical.

### Test Structure

- Tests should live in a dedicated top-level `tests/` area and mirror the project's
  module structure where practical.
- Keep test code separate from production module code.
- Avoid external I/O in unit tests; use in-memory databases or test doubles when
  appropriate.
- Boundary checks should validate runtime import rules and module public API contracts.

## Code Style and Conventions

This document describes architectural rules. Language- and tool-specific coding
conventions belong in the language-specific convention documents (for example,
`docs/design/python_conventions.md`). High-level expectations:

### General

- Prefer explicit and clear code over clever or implicit constructs.
- Avoid circular dependencies between modules.
- Infrastructure implementations should be provided by the composition root and not
  imported into domain logic.

### Encoding & I/O

- Treat UTF-8 as the canonical encoding for text content. When reading or writing files,
  specify encoding explicitly if the platform or language requires it.

## Design Principles

### Explicit Over Implicit

Code should say what it is doing. Avoid magic, reflection, and implicit conventions.

### Fail Fast

Validate early and raise descriptive errors.

### Immutability

Domain entities and events should be treated as immutable where practical. Use the
appropriate language-level mechanisms (for example, read-only data structures, immutable
value objects, or explicit freezing patterns) to enforce immutability for state objects
and events. Document any language-specific enforcement techniques in the language
convention documents.

### No Surprises

If code looks like it does X, it does X. No side effects, no hidden state mutations.

### Cohesion Over Abstraction

Keep related code together. Separate only when there is a genuine reason.
